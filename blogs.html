    <h2>College Life</h2>
    <p>Technology is often ridiculed for minimizing social interaction.<br>
        And, true, you might be more inclined to scroll through Instagram <br>
        while you’re waiting for class to start than striking up a conversation<br>
        with the stranger sitting next to you—but when it comes to bonding over <br>
        the human experience, the Internet facilitates a discussion more open <br>
        and farther-reaching than ever before. For instance, how often do you<br>
        read a tweet that makes you realize, “Wait, other people feel like <br>
        that, too? I’m not the only one?”</p>

    <p>The best place to get information about college life is from the people who <br>
         have gone through the experience themselves. They know the best ways to get 
          through the circumstances that are as of yet unknown to you and are eager<br>
           to help you figure them out. Reading through these blogs will make you <br>
        feel as if you have a virtual older sibling guiding you through this next stage of your life. </p>

        <p>The protests in Iran — sparked over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, on September 16 — have entered their 10th week.<br>According to the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO (IHRNGO), at least 326 people have been killed by Iranian security forces since the beginning of the urban revolts. <br>Among those killed by government agents were 40 children, who happened to be in a car or standing on the sidewalk. The most recent name on the list of children killed is <br>that of Kian Pirfalak, a nine-year-old from the western city of Izeh. Kian’s parents took away his body covered in ice, fearing that it would be taken by the security <br>forces — as has happened in numerous other cases. But despite the killings of citizens all over Iran, the demonstrators returned to the streets to mark 40th-day <br>remembrances for those slain earlier, in the Shiʿi tradition.<br>

            <br>As such, while public anger and frustration continue, out of the 290 members of the Iranian Parliament, 227 have urged the country’s judiciary to “show no leniency” <br>to the 13,000 protesters arrested. Despite the efforts of Iranian human rights activists around the world and the symbolic sanctions implemented by countries like <br>Canada, the UK and the European Council, there has been no real negative effect on Iranian officials. People around the world, including Indians, are totally <br>indifferent to the fate of the Iranian people, while the death toll of protestors is rising every day and the mass trials of those arrested are fast approaching.<br>

            <br>The arrest of thousands of protestors in the past few months was supplemented by a government clampdown on journalists, students, scholars, doctors and lawyers. <br>According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, 51 journalists were arrested in the past 10 weeks in Iran. On October 30, Human Rights Watch <br>estimated that at least 308 university students had been arrested by the regime’s forces since the protests began. Also, according to some human rights activists <br>inside Iran, as of the beginning of November 2022, Iranian intelligence agencies had arrested 130 human rights defenders, 38 women’s rights defenders, 36 political <br>activists, and 19 lawyers. According to the Iranian judiciary’s news agency, indictments had been issued in the following provinces: 201 in Alborz, 119 in Zanjan, 110 <br>in Kurdistan, 105 in Khuzestan, 89 in Semnan, 55 in Qazvin, 25 in Kerman and 1,000 in Tehran alone. In addition to this, on October 30, Branch 15 of the Revolutionary <br>Court in Tehran charged six protestors with “waging war,” “corruption of the earth,” and “collusion against national security”.<br>
            
            <br>While students and young women continue to play a prominent role in the protests, the protestors are from all walks of life. Surprisingly, unlike the previous social <br>movements in 2009 and 2017, the current protest does not seem to be dying down. This is due to two main reasons: First, Iranian teenagers and students have become <br>more courageous and resilient than their parents, mainly because they have no future in front of them. Second, the regime’s moral legitimacy is wearing so thin that <br>nothing emanating from its military or political institutions carries any credibility.<br>
            
            <br>Therefore, the Iranian regime, in a desperate bid to distract its followers within and outside the country, is looking for spies everywhere. All the confused <br>narrative about the so-called ISIS “terrorist” attack on the Shah Cheragh shrine, the horrific fire in Evin Prison and the arrest of five “French spies” in Iran shows <br>the disarray in the regime, which has great difficulty explaining to the world why it is brutalising its own people. In the past two months, Iranian artists, <br>intellectuals and athletes have shown striking solidarity with protesters. The latest example of such a sense of unity was when Iran’s national football team chose <br>not to sing the country’s anthem before their World Cup match against England on November 21. Monday’s match was an opportunity for Iranian football players to show <br>their discontent — in public — with the killing of children and young people by the Iranian government.</p>

            <p>The Paradise of Food (Juggernaut) by Khalid Jawed, translated from the Urdu Nemat Khana, has won the ₹25 lakh prize 2022 JCB Prize for Literature. Jawed explores the <br>travails of existence and squalor through the metaphor of food. Translated by Baran Farooqi, it tells the story of an orphaned boy, Zahiruddin Babar, who is brought <br>up in a joint family, and looks at life from different angles. He is an outsider both at home and in the world.<br>

                <br>“We look for happiness in every corner, and today I feel I have found happiness by winning this Prize,” he said, accepting it in New Delhi. “I didn’t expect this <br>at all, I wrote this novel in Urdu in 2014,” he said, thanking his translator for transforming his novel into another language so beautifully. The JCB Prize jury, <br>chaired by A.S. Panneerselvan, said it is a brutal and mesmerising account of the contemporary body, home and nation told through food and the kitchen. It also <br>praised the translation which highlights the poetry and music of the original text.<br>
                
                <br>Baran Farooqi thanked her father, the Urdu litterateur Shamshur Rahman Faruqi, who introduced her to Urdu, and had first brought Jawed’s writing to her notice. <br>Pointing out that Urdu has become a little bit of a stranger in India today, she said it needed people to spread the word because this “stranger has many things <br>to say.” In a review in The Hindu, Shafey Kidwai had written that the novel uses food as a central trope to blur the lines between reality, fantasy and memory.<br>

                <br>In its fifth edition, the JCB Prize shortlist had five books, all translations. The other books in the shortlist were Manorajan Byapari’s Imaan (Eka), translated <br>by Arunava Sinha from the Bengali Chhera Chhera Jeebon; Sheela Tomy’s Valli (Harper Perennial), translated by Jayasree Kalathil; Geetanjali Shree’s Tomb of Sand <br>(Ret Samadhi), translated by Daisy Rockwell; and Song of the Soil(Rachna Books), by Chuden Kabimo, translated from the Nepali by Ajit Baral.<br>

                <br>In an interview to JCB Prize, Jawed said that he was always interested to communicate and express himself, even as a child. He had always noticed that the <br>instruments used in making food had an element of violence in them – the knife used to chop vegetables, the stone slab meant to grind spices, the hot griddle, <br>tongs, pliers, all things can be used for violence – and it led me to thinking, “isn’t the world just like a kitchen,” and wove his story around it.<br>

                <br>All the books “bring forth the many Indias across time and geography, [and is] representative of the spectrum of languages… that India has to offer,” said Mita <br>Kapur, Literary Director, of the JCB Prize for Literature. Last year, M. Mukundan won the JCB Prize for his novel, Delhi: A Soliloquy, translated from the <br>Malayalam by Fathima E.V.<br></p>
