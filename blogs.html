    <h2>College Life</h2>
    <p>Technology is often ridiculed for minimizing social interaction.<br>
        And, true, you might be more inclined to scroll through Instagram <br>
        while you’re waiting for class to start than striking up a conversation<br>
        with the stranger sitting next to you—but when it comes to bonding over <br>
        the human experience, the Internet facilitates a discussion more open <br>
        and farther-reaching than ever before. For instance, how often do you<br>
        read a tweet that makes you realize, “Wait, other people feel like <br>
        that, too? I’m not the only one?”</p>

    <p>The best place to get information about college life is from the people who <br>
         have gone through the experience themselves. They know the best ways to get <br>
          through the circumstances that are as of yet unknown to you and are eager<br>
           to help you figure them out. Reading through these blogs will make you <br>
        feel as if you have a virtual older sibling guiding you through this next stage of your life. </p>
